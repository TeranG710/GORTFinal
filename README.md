## Business Problem
Financial institutions, investors, and creditors need reliable methods to assess the bankruptcy risk of companies they're considering investing in or extending credit to. By analyzing financial ratios and creating a predictive model, we can identify early warning signs of potential bankruptcy. This would allow stakeholders to:

1. Make more informed investment decisions
2. Adjust lending terms based on risk profiles
3. Implement early intervention strategies for companies at risk
4. Optimize portfolio management by balancing risk exposure
